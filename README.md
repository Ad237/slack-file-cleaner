# slack-file-cleaner

This is a simple application written for a slack team I am apart of that has been suffering with the 5GB maximum storage limitation given to free plans by slack. I have posted it here for others to use however I do not intend to provide support for it.

**NOTICE:** The application is only able to delete files that the user has permissions to view/delete. This is best ran from an administator account, as well as the most frequently active users.

## Requirements

* [slackbotapi by @xBytez](https://github.com/xBytez/slackbotapi)

## Usage

* Replace 'YOUR_TOKEN_HERE' with a valid API token generated by Slack.
* Run 'npm install' to install the dependencies.
* Run 'node index.js' and the application will begin deleting files.
